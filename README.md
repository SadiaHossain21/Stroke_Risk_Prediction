# Stroke Risk Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of stroke based on patient health data. It was developed as part of an MSc Statistical Machine Learning Course.

## Project Overview

The notebook `stroke-risk-prediction.ipynb` walks through the entire data science process:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Selecting important features
- Handling class imbalance
- Training machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance
- Interpreting the results

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Kaggle Notebook
- Dataset (Taken from Kaggle)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stroke-risk-prediction.git
2. Open the folder and launch the notebook using Jupyter:
cd stroke-risk-prediction
jupyter notebook stroke-risk-prediction.ipynb
3. Run all cells in order.

## Dataset
The dataset includes medical and lifestyle details such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Hypertension
- Heart disease
- Smoking status
- BMI
- Glucose level

The target variable is whether the patient has had a stroke.

## Objective

The aim is to build an accurate and interpretable model that can help flag individuals at higher risk of stroke for early medical intervention.
